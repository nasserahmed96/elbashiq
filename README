ElBashiq is a wrapper for C sockets, it's used for simple message transfering and handles network search and destination selection, it's not complete yet,
but I have tested it to transfer data between Mobile phone, Laptop and Raspberry PI, the main intention was to transfer commands to RapsberryPI.


*ElBashiq is a word used to describe small falcons in Egypt, and was used by the archaeologists to descibe Horus
